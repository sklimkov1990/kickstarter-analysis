# kickstarter-analysis


## Project Overview

Louise wants to run a fundraising campaign and she asked us to run a data analysis for her. She would like to know how different campaignes did and whether or not the launching dates as well as fundrasing goals had any effect on the campsigns' outcomes.
The questions we will need to answer by analazing the data set in Excell are:
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Theater Outcomes based on Launch Date?
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

## Analysis and Challenges

We have been using pivot-tables as well as pivot charts to manipulate and vizualize the data to where it's useful for our goals. The mail challenge was to learn which field in the table should be matched with what variable in order to generate the right output. I overcame that objection by looking the right way online and studying the module, as well as continiously practing this chellenge. 


## Results
- Based on launch date, we can see that first of all May had the largest number of successful Theater campaigns (111) and in June had the second largest number of successful Theater campaigns (100). Secondly, we can see that December is the month with the least number of successful campaigns. This helps us draw a conslusion that May might be the best month to launch the campaign, based on the launch date.
- Having looked at the Theater campaigns and their success based no their initial fundraising goals, we can see that the highest number of successful campaigns had the initial goal between $1000 and $4,999. It might be worth considering for Louise to consider the goal for the Theater campigns in that range.
- One of the limitations of this data set is the lack of demographic data on the backers to look into if there's any correlation between that and the output.
- Based on the demographic data we could build more pivot charts and tables.
